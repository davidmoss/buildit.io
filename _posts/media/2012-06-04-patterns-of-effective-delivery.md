Some programmers are simply more effective than others. Kent Beck famously described himself as "not a great programmer, but a good programmer with great habits."

Over the last year or so I've been working with, and observing, some very good programmers with quite exceptional - and rather surprising - habits.Is there a better way than katas to learn a new language? Is copy-and-paste always evil? Should you always test-drive production code?

In this talk Dan introduces the idea of programming patterns - patterns of effective programming behaviour - and describes some of the more unusual but effective programming patterns he's collected over the last year.

These are not patterns for beginners, but then again, Dan argues that patterns aren't for beginners anyway.
